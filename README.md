GameJam 2020: 'Everything has a cost'

Authors: daniel632 (unity / dev) and amybuc (art and design)


## TODO:

- Green / red resource highlight during outcome screens to indicate resource increase / decrease
- Implement randomness for action outcomes
- Make resources more important. They don't really do anything besides allow the player to transition between events (and even that is broken - read below bug)
- Esc / Menu functionality


## BUGS:

- Resources can hit zero and actions / events which lower them further have no consequence. When this happens, we should probably lower population or something else.


## Description:

The world is at war. You home is now a settlement for remnants of what was once a peaceful society.

Survive for as long as you can and try to maximise the number of people you save. Who knows, help may just arrive one day...

You will need to carefully balance your settlement's Defense, Morale and Supplies. These resources will be lost and gained through your everyday survival. Everything has a cost.
